# Modules are not only useful for grouping common methods together, 
# but they're also useful for namespacing. Namespacing is where similar
# classes are grouped within a module. This makes it easier to recognize the
# purpose of the contained classes. Grouping classes in a module can also help
# avoid collision with classes of the same name
