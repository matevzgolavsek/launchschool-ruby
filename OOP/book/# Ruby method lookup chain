# Ruby method lookup chain

When calling a Ruby method we may not realize there is a lot of stuff happening in the back. One of the most important things is where the method is decleared and how it behave. We call this the method lookup.


## Ancestors chain

Method lookup goes through the ancestor chain of an object to find where method is decleared.

Let's start with one of the Ruby built in methods `ancestors` which we call on any class to find out the method lookup chain. With calling this method we will get a list of all superclasses and modules that are included in.

```
module Walk
  def Walk(sound)
    puts "#{sound}"
  end
end

class Animal
  include Walk
end

class Dog < Animal
  def speak
    "Woof Woof!"
  end
end

puts Dog.ancestors
```
